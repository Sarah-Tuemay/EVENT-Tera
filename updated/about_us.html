            <p class="highlight">
                EVENT ተራ (Event Tera) is a platform dedicated to centralizing and
                aggregating fragmented information about local, free community events
                in Ethiopia.

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    To significantly boost social engagement among young adults and
                    students by making local events easily discoverable and accessible
                    to everyone.

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Our Community</h2>
                <p>
                    We serve young adults, students, and anyone interested in
                    discovering free cultural gatherings, workshops, and social
                    activities across Ethiopian cities.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Values</h2>
                <p>
                    We believe in free access to community events, cultural preservation, and connections that strengthen local communities.

                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <div class="story-content">
                    <p>
                        EVENT ተራ was born from a simple observation: amazing community events were happening all around Ethiopian cities, but information about them was scattered across social media posts, word of mouth, and various platforms. Young adults and students were missing out on incredible opportunities simply because they didn't know these events existed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We created EVENT ተራ to solve this problem by building a centralized platform where anyone can discover free local events - from poetry nights and cultural performances to tech meetups and community workshops.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our platform is designed to be simple, accessible, and focused on what matters: helping people find and attend events that enrich their lives and strengthen community bonds.
