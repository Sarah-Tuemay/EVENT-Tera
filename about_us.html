      EVENT ተራ (Event Tera) is a platform dedicated to centralizing 
      and aggregating fragmented information about local, free community 
      events in Ethiopia.

    <h2> Our Story</h2>
    <pre>
        EVENT ተራ was born from a simple observation:
        amazing community events were happening all around 
        Ethiopian cities, but information about them was
        scattered across social media posts, 
        word of mouth, and various platforms.

        Young adults and students were missing out on incredible
        opportunities to connect, learn, and engage with their
        communities simply because they didn't know these events
        existed.

        We created EVENT ተራ to solve this problem by building a 
        centralized platform where anyone can discover free local 
        events - from poetry nights and cultural performances to 
        tech meetups and community workshops.

        Our platform is designed to be simple, accessible, and focused
        on what matters: helping people find and attend events that 
        enrich their lives and strengthen community bonds.
